Introduction

In recent years, the English Premier League (EPL) has witnessed notable shifts in tactical approaches, with many teams adopting more aggressive, attack-focused strategies. These changes are often reflected in match statistics, particularly in the number of shots taken per game—a commonly used proxy for offensive intent. Over the past two decades, the league has undergone significant stylistic evolution, with teams increasingly adopting more attack-oriented strategies. This shift is evident in the rising average number of shots taken per match, as illustrated in our research, suggesting a broader trend toward aggressive offensive play.

This study seeks to investigate the relationship between offensive output—measured by the average number of shots per game—and competitive success, as indicated by win rate. Drawing on match-level data from the 2000/01 to 2024/25 EPL seasons, we aim to explore whether a more aggressive attacking style correlates with improved outcomes, or whether teams with more balanced or conservative tactics can still achieve comparable or even better results. By focusing on the most recent decade of EPL seasons (2015/16 to 2024/25), this research captures contemporary tactical patterns while offering relevant insights into the evolving dynamics of top-tier football.
