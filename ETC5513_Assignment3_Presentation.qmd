Over the last two decades, the English Premier League (EPL) has seen a clear tactical shift — teams are taking more shots per game than ever before.

This rise in shot volume reflects a growing emphasis on attacking play and offensive intensity.

**But is this always a good thing?**

This study investigates whether teams that take more shots actually perform better — or if aggressive playstyles are not necessarily rewarded with more wins

## Dataset Overview

::::: columns
::: {.column .smaller width="50%"}
![](data/kaggle_ss.png)

:::

::: {.column .smaller width="45%"}
Seasons used: **2015/16 to 2024/25**

Extracted variables:

-   `Season`

-   `HomeTeam`, `AwayTeam`

-   `FullTimeResult`

-   `HomeShots`, `AwayShots`

## Final Dataset and Variables

```{r}
#| label: tbl-variabletable
#| tbl-cap: Table of Variable Names for Constructed Dataset

library(kableExtra)

variable_description <- tibble::tibble(
  Variable = c("Season", "Team", "TotalMatches", "TotalShots", "TotalWins", 
               "AvgShotsPerGame", "WinRatePercent"),
  Description = c(
    "The English Premier League season (e.g., '2015/16')",
    "Name of the football team",
    "Total number of matches played by the team that season",
    "Total number of shots taken by the team across the season",
    "Total number of wins recorded by the team that season",
    "Average number of shots made by the team each game in that season",
    "Win rate percentage (TotalWins / TotalMatches * 100)"))

kbl(variable_description) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 17)
```

-   The final dataset contains 200 observations and 7 variables.

-   **Win Rate Percent as performance indicator:** Reflects a team’s ability to outperform opponents and wins yield the most league points.

## Methodology {.smaller}

```{r}
# Get stats for home games
home_stats <- epl_recent %>%
  mutate(
    Team = HomeTeam,
    Shots = HomeShots,
    Win = ifelse(FullTimeResult == "H", 1, 0)
  ) %>%
  select(Season, Team, Shots, Win)

# Get stats for away games
away_stats <- epl_recent %>%
  mutate(
    Team = AwayTeam,
    Shots = AwayShots,
    Win = ifelse(FullTimeResult == "A", 1, 0)
  ) %>%
  select(Season, Team, Shots, Win)

# Combine datasets for home and away stats
team_match_data <- bind_rows(home_stats, away_stats)

team_season_summary <- team_match_data %>%
  group_by(Season, Team) %>%
  summarise(
    TotalMatches = n(),
    TotalShots = sum(Shots, na.rm = TRUE),
    TotalWins = sum(Win, na.rm = TRUE),
    AvgShotsPerGame = TotalShots / TotalMatches,
    WinRatePercent = 100 * TotalWins / TotalMatches
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

team_season_summary %>%
  head(4) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Table 2: Preview of Team-Season Summary Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 16)
```

To explore the relationship between **offensive output** and **match success**, we conducted a season-by-season analysis of team performance in the EPL.

-   We calculated **Average Shots Per Game** and **Win Rate Percent** for each team in each season.
-   Each row in the dataset represents a **team-season** combination.
-   We visualized the relationship using a **scatter plot**, with:
    -   X-axis: **AvgShotsPerGame**
    -   Y-axis: **WinRatePercent**
-   This allows us to assess whether teams that shoot more tend to **win more matches**.

-   Positive Correlation: Generally, teams that take **take shots per game tend to win more.**

-   **34 EPL Teams** visualized with distinct colors across multiple seasons.

-   **Faceted by Season** to highlight year-on-year trends and variations.

-   **Exceptions**:

    -   Liverpool (2023/24) averaged **21 shots/game** but had a **lower win rate** than Man City, who averaged **18 shots/game** and won more.

## Conclusions

-   Analysis reveals a **strong positive relationship** between **average shots per game** and **win rate** among EPL Teams.

-   Teams that generate more shots generally see better results over a season, which highlights the importance of **attacking strategies** leading the teams to success.

-   While not perfectly linear, the trend is **consistent and meaningful** across all seasons.

-   To enhance the analysis, we can consider adding **more variables** like shot quality or defensive metrics for an even deeper understanding.
