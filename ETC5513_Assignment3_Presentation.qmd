## Another Slide

\- Item 1

(Over the past two decades, the English Premier League (EPL) has undergone significant tactical transformation. Many clubs have shifted from traditionally balanced or defensive systems toward more aggressive, attack-oriented approaches. This evolution is visible in match statistics, with an upward trend in the average number of shots taken per game. Shots are commonly used as a proxy for offensive intent, and their increase suggests a broader strategic emphasis on attacking play. )

Item 2

(However, while modern football increasingly prioritizes creating scoring opportunities, it remains unclear whether more aggressive offensive styles consistently yield better outcomes. Do teams that take more shots necessarily win more matches, or can success also be achieved through more conservative or balanced approaches. This study seeks to explore the relationship between offensive output and team performance in the EPL. Specifically, we investigate whether a higher average number of shots per game correlates with a higher win rate across seasons.)

## Final Dataset and Variables

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

variable_description <- tibble::tibble(
  Variable = c("Season", "Team", "TotalMatches", "TotalShots", "TotalWins", 
               "AvgShotsPerGame", "WinRatePercent"),
  Description = c(
    "The English Premier League season (e.g., '2015/16')",
    "Name of the football team",
    "Total number of matches played by the team that season",
    "Total number of shots taken by the team across the season",
    "Total number of wins recorded by the team that season",
    "Average number of shots made by the team each game in that season",
    "Win rate percentage (TotalWins / TotalMatches * 100)"))

kbl(variable_description, caption = "Variable Descriptions of Final Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 17)
```

- The final dataset contains 200 observations and 7 variables.

- **Win Rate Percent as performance indicator:** Reflects a team’s ability to outperform opponents and wins yield the most league points.

## Methodology {.smaller}

```{r}
# Get stats for home games
home_stats <- epl_recent %>%
  mutate(
    Team = HomeTeam,
    Shots = HomeShots,
    Win = ifelse(FullTimeResult == "H", 1, 0)
  ) %>%
  select(Season, Team, Shots, Win)

# Get stats for away games
away_stats <- epl_recent %>%
  mutate(
    Team = AwayTeam,
    Shots = AwayShots,
    Win = ifelse(FullTimeResult == "A", 1, 0)
  ) %>%
  select(Season, Team, Shots, Win)

# Combine datasets for home and away stats
team_match_data <- bind_rows(home_stats, away_stats)

team_season_summary <- team_match_data %>%
  group_by(Season, Team) %>%
  summarise(
    TotalMatches = n(),
    TotalShots = sum(Shots, na.rm = TRUE),
    TotalWins = sum(Win, na.rm = TRUE),
    AvgShotsPerGame = TotalShots / TotalMatches,
    WinRatePercent = 100 * TotalWins / TotalMatches
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

team_season_summary %>%
  head(4) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Preview of Team-Season Summary Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 16)
```


To explore the relationship between **offensive output** and **match success**, we conducted a season-by-season analysis of team performance in the EPL.

- We calculated **Average Shots Per Game** and **Win Rate Percent** for each team in each season.
- Each row in the dataset represents a **team-season** combination.
- We visualized the relationship using a **scatter plot**, with:
  - X-axis: **AvgShotsPerGame**
  - Y-axis: **WinRatePercent**
- This allows us to assess whether teams that shoot more tend to **win more matches**.
