-   Positive Correlation: Generally, teams that take **take shots per game tend to win more.**

-   **34 EPL Teams** visualized with distinct colors across multiple seasons.

-   **Faceted by Season** to highlight year-on-year trends and variations.

-   **Exceptions**:

    -   Liverpool (2023/24) averaged **21 shots/game** but had a **lower win rate** than Man City, who averaged **18 shots/game** and won more.
